 Halliburton said it cut more than 6,000 jobs in the first quarter, during which revenue slumped 40.4 percent and it took a $2.1 billion restructuring charge mainly for severance costs and asset write-offs amid the prolonged slump in oil prices. 
  Halliburton also postponed its earnings conference call to May 3 from April 25 to accommodate the April 30 deadline to close its acquisition of Baker Hughes, the company said in a statement after the U.S. market closed on Friday. 
  The No.2 oilfield services provider is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Monday, April 25. Baker Hughes is due to report on April 27, but has not held conference calls since the merger was announced in 2014.
