Figures from the U.S. government point to jobs losses in Texas as well, at least anecdotally.
  "We didn't see any impact on the labor market until January of this year," said Pia Orrenius, vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "It took a little bit of time at first and now it's hitting at full force." 
  Those cutbacks have come from some good paying jobs, too.
  "Typically, those were higher paying jobs we've lost," said David Anderson, an economist at Texas A&M University. "So those people who have lost their job start spending less money, and we see it show up in ... restaurants, car purchases, and stuff like that." 
Orrenius also pointed to losses in Houston. "We've seen that the situation in Houston is getting worse, and the rest of the state has remained stable. Even if you're going to see improvement regionally like North Texas, or Central Texas around Austin, you're not going to see it in Houston. Houston is going to be suffering for a while."
