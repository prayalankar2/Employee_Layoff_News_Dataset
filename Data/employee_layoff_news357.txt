 Weatherford International plans to cut 5,000 jobs, or about 9 percent of its workforce, by the end of the first quarter as the oil services company tries to save costs amid sinking oil prices and budget cuts. 
  The job cuts will focus on both operating and support positions and a majority of the reductions will be in the Western Hemisphere, the company said in a statement.

  Weatherford, which currently employs about 56,000 people across the world, expects the job cuts to result in annualized savings of over $350 million. 
  "Due to the quickly changing market conditions, we are aligning and reducing our cost as well as organizational structures to match the new environment," the company said.
