  It's only a matter of time before U.S. banks operating in the United Kingdom and European Union have some potential regulatory and staffing issues to sort through as a result of the U.K. Brexit vote in June. 
  But it may not be the issues that the pundits projected. 
In the immediate wake of the Brexit referendum, reports surfaced projecting mass layoffs at U.S. banks' U.K. arms; Morgan Stanley issued a denial to a widely-circulated story alleging the bank would cut 2,000 jobs. But, according to one expert, bank staffers may have little  to nothing  to sweat. 

 "I'm not sure it's going to be layoffs; it's going to be shifts of employees," said John Stadtler, U.S. financial services industry group leader at PwC. "Post-Brexit, you will have more jobs in countries in the European Union and U.K. The question is, where those jobs will be." 
 So while U.K. bankers may not be wise to lay out a down payment on a mortgage quite yet, they also may still have brighter days ahead. It just could require moving to another country.
