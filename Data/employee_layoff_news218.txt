  The higher number of layoffs seems, at the surface, odd as weekly jobless claims fall to historic lows.  
In fact, the four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 2,000 to 263,250 last week, the lowest level since December 1973. 
  Challenger said that even though more people are being laid off, they are wading in the unemployment pool for shorter periods. 
  "It means that people are getting picked up quickly," he said. "Even with the heavier layoffs more people in a tight labor market can make quicker transitions."  
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average duration of unemployment was 26.3 weeks in September, compared with 31.8 weeks for the same period in 2014.
