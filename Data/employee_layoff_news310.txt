  J&J's medical device sales reached almost $19 billion in the first nine months of 2015, but fell 10.4 percent, making the wide array of products the company's poorest-performing segment.  
  By contrast, sales of J&J's prescription drugs fell 3.9 percent and sales of its consumer products fell 6.5 percent in the same period, also hurt by a stronger dollar which lowers sales in overseas markets. 
  The company said it expected to record pretax restructuring charges of $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion in connection with these plans, of which about $600 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Leerink analysts said the announcement meant that an acquisition was still in the cards for J&J, given that it had about $37 billion in cash as of the end of the third quarter.  
  "We continue to believe JNJ is an active acquirer with a focus likely heavily weighted toward it s lagging medical devices business ... it's a matter of when, not if, J&J does a deal," they wrote in a note. 
  J&J also reiterated its full-year 2015 forecast, and said the restructuring in the devices business would not affect the $10 billion share repurchase program.  
  The restructuring is expected to produce annualized pretax cost savings of $800 million to $1 billion, J&J said. Most savings are expected by the end of 2018, including about $200 million in 2016. 
  New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J employs about 60,000 within its medical devices unit, part of a global workforce of about 127,000. 
  The Band-Aid maker is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 26.
