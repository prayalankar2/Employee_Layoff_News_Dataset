  Binladin prospered during Saudi Arabia's economic boom in the past decade, employing around 200,000 workers as it built many of the kingdom's flagship infrastructure projects including airports, roads and skyscrapers. 
  But like many other Saudi construction firms, it has been hit hard in the past year as low oil prices have prompted the government to slash spending in an effort to curb a budget deficit that totaled nearly $100 billion last year. 
  Labor market reforms, designed to push more Saudi citizens into private sector jobs, have since 2011 made it more difficult and expensive for construction firms to hire foreign workers, pressuring the industry. 
  In September, the Saudi royal court said Binladin had been suspended from taking new contracts after a crane toppled into Mecca's Grand Mosque during a dust storm, killing 107 people. 
  An initial government probe found Binladin had not properly secured the crane. Binladin did not issue a public statement in response to the suspension.
