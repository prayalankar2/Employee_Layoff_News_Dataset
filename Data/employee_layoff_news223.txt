) - Japan Display Inc is considering restructuring beyond cutting jobs and consolidating production, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as its late entry into OLED technology caused loss of business with Apple Inc.
Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei business daily reported the firm was looking at capital and business tie-ups, and seeking aid from investment funds including government-led technology venture Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ).
Deeper restructuring would come just six months after INCJ agreed to invest up to 75 billion yen ($685 million) in the liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, and five years after INCJ helped form Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp.
INCJ's role in rescuing Japan's struggling tech industry could intensify as it considers buying a stake in the chip business that Toshiba has put up for sale to help cover billions of dollars of cost overruns at its nuclear unit.
INVESTMENT DELAY
In a statement on Wednesday, Japan Display said it would delay increasing investment in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel maker JOLED Inc pending a new mid-term business plan, which would include Japan Display's strategy for commercializing the technology for smartphones.
An agreement on raising its investment from the current 15 percent would be made by June 2018, the company said, a year later than previous plans for later this month.
Japan Display will announce a new medium-term business plan by August, after appointing a new management team at its annual shareholders meeting later this month, the Nikkei reported.
Shares in Japan Display ended nearly 10 percent higher following the Nikkei report, which a Japan Display spokesman said was not based on any announcement by the company.
