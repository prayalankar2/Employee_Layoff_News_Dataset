) - Chinese TV and smartphone vendor LeEco said it will cut over 300 jobs at its U.S. business, amounting to almost three-quarters of its local workforce, as the cash-strapped conglomerate streamlines global operations in response to a shortage of cash.
The cuts are aimed at increasing focus on LeEco's home market and core TV set and online content business after founder Jia Yueting last year said expansion had been too quick and costly.
LeEco stretched from video streaming to TV sets, smartphones, sports and even electric vehicles in a little over a decade, employing 14,000 people globally as of late last year.
"The breadth of our business model is capital intensive," LeEco said in a statement. This "made it difficult in the past few months to support" all its businesses.
"As a result, the capital we do have will have to be highly focused resulting in a significant restructuring and streamlining of our business, operations and workforce."
