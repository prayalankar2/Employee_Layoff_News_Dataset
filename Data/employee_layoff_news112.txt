  Last week, reports surfaced that Dorsey was planning company-wide layoffs at Twitter  that could affect all departments. Dorsey had been named permanent CEO on Oct. 5.  
  According to Re/code, the downsizing came at a time when the company is restructuring its engineering organization to make it more efficient. The cuts could therefore affect mostly engineers, per the report.  
  As of the second quarter of this year, Twitter disclosed that it had 4,100 employees. "In June Dorsey told Re/code that the company needed to do a better job of "clarifying ownership" around projects, and he restructured Twitter's product team in August to do just that," the report noted.  
 (Disclosure: CNBC's parent NBC Universal is an investor in Re/code's parent Revere Digital, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.)
