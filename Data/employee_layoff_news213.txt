) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rebounded from a near 44-year low, but the labor market continues to tighten amid a sharp drop in job cuts in February.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised at 223,000, the lowest level since March 1973.
"There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations. We view this as evidence of a tight labor market," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Jobless claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 105 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 236,500 last week.
A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S.-based employers announced 36,957 job cuts in February, down 19 percent from January. Layoffs tumbled 40 percent compared to February last year.
The labor market is at or close to full employment, with employers increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers for open job positions.
The sustained strength in the jobs market is likely to be corroborated on Friday with the release of the government's closely watched employment report for February.
