  Oil prices have risen since the middle of February, but were down 43 percent from a year ago. 
  "Low oil prices continue to take a toll on workers in the energy and industrial goods sectors. Since January of 2015, these two sectors alone have seen workforce reductions in excess of 200,000, the majority of which were attributed to oil prices," Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. 
  Thus far, the pain in the oil and gas patch has not spread into the wider economy in areas that benefited from America's energy boom prior to the downturn, Challenger reported. The firm noted Houston's unemployment rate ticked up slightly from 4 percent to 4.6 percent in December, while it has fallen slightly in Bismarck, North Dakota. 
  The technology sector also saw an uptick in layoffs, with about 16,000 cuts announced in the first two months of the year, up 143 percent from last year. 
  The Challenger report comes a day before the Labor Department releases its February jobs data. On Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics said U.S. companies hired 214,000 employees in February.
