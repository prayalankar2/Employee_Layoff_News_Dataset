  The job cuts come after a slowdown in growth of Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera. The company also reported better-than-expected third-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.48 a share on sales of $2.8 billion. Analysts had estimated earnings of $3.80 a share on $2.65 billion in revenue. Tecfidera sales also topped estimates, at $937 million for the quarter, versus expectations of $892 million. 
  Separately, Biogen reported that another of its multiple sclerosis drugs, Tysabri, failed in a late-stage clinical trial in a form of the disease known as secondary progressive MS.
