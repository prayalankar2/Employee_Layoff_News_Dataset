) - Archer Daniels Midland Co is restructuring its operations in Argentina in a move that will include job losses as part of a wider shake-up at the U.S. agribusiness group, three sources familiar with the plans said this week.
Chicago-based ADM is grappling with volatile global grain markets and has already exited energy trading and shed key personnel in recent months. It said on Wednesday it planned to close its South African trading operations.
In the latest development, ADM late last month shuttered its Toepfer grains trading unit, which had been based outside Buenos Aires, according to three industry sources familiar with the situation.

"There was some overlapping of functions between ADM and Toepfer. Redundant activities were cut," said a Buenos Aires- based industry source with direct knowledge of the situation.
