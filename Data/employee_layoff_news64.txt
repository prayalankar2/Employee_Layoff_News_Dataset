  One of the article's key points is that "Conforming to norms is an easy and safe spot to be in. If we are willing to deviate, there are upsides." That is true in investing, no doubt. But when it comes to professional attire? Not so much. 
The idea that wearing sweatpants in a luxury-goods store means you are more likely to spend more money is stupid. Is there is any actual data of the sweatpants-wearing guy actually spending a dime in that Prada store?
Oh, and if you see a well-dressed guy mulling around the store not spending money  he's probably just killing time waiting for his friend before a three-martini lunch.
Sorry sweatpants guy  no respect from me.
