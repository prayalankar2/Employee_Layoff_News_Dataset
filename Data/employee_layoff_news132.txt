  Schlumberger on Thursday reported negative margins for North America for the first time since the oil slump started. Margins become negative when costs exceed revenue earned. 
  Halliburton said it expects spending on drilling and completion services to fall 50 percent in North America this year, following a 40 percent decline last year. It expects global spending to drop 30 percent for the second straight year. 
  U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs this week to the lowest level since November 2009, Baker Hughes said. 
  Halliburton said it expects that the second quarter will mark the "landing point" for rig count. The company said it typically sees margins improving at least a one quarter after rig count flattens.
