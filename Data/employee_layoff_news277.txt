U.S. drug distributor McKesson is cutting 1,600 jobs, or about 4 percent of its U.S. workforce, to slash costs after the company lost some key customers, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
McKesson began a strategic review in January and decided that "reductions to our workforce would be necessary to align our cost structure with our business needs," Bloomberg reported, citing an e-mailed statement from the company.
The company started informing workers about the lay-offs in mid-March, Bloomberg said.

McKesson, which distributes drugs to retailers such as CVS Health, said in January its fiscal 2017 earnings would likely be hit by weak generic drug pricing.
