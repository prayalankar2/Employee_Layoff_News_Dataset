Zynga, the 7-year-old social gaming company behind the ubiquitous Words with Friends and Farmville, announced the layoffs of 314 employees this week, which amounts to about 15 percent of its staff. The company hopes the cuts will save them up to $35 million this year. Zynga currently employs 2,100 people, down from 3,300 in 2012.
