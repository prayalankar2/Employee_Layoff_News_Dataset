  Though the energy sector topped the list of biggest cutters, layoffs have slowed. Energy companies announced 4,414 cuts in October, versus 50,000 cuts in the first three months of 2016.
Challenger told CNBC the report's numbers will likely correlate with Friday's employment report from the Labor Department. "There just isn't much pressure on companies to lay people off right now," he said.
  Challenger said election jitters have contributed little to the slowing monthly rate of cuts, instead taking a more positive tone. 
  "This low monthly total is most likely due to the fact the economy is relatively healthy and that most employers don't see those conditions changing in the next three to six months," he said in the company's report. 
  To date, employers have announced 466,352 job cuts this year.
