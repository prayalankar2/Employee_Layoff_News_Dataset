  The overall figures mask a wide range of economic impact on the hardest hit states and counties whose economies rely most heavily on oil and gas production. Oil and gas industry wages in California, for example, fell by more than $300 million in the first quarter. But the industry makes up a much smaller share of the state's overall employment than the national average. 
  In Oklahoma, on the other hand, oil and gas industry jobs represent roughly 10 times the national average on a per-capita basis. The Sooner state has been among the hardest hit, with oil and gas industry wages falling in the first quarter by nearly $1 billion on an annualized basis. 
  The contrast is even more pronounced at the county level. Harris County, Texas, which is home to Houston, saw wages drop by more than a billion dollars on an annualized basis in the first quarter. That's a big hit, but represents less than one percent of total wages in the country, according to the BLS data. 
  In much less populous Washington County, Oklahoma, oil and gas industry wages dropped by $11.5 million in the first quarter, or more than $45 million on an annualized basis. That's nearly 4 percent of all countywide wages, according to the latest BLS data.
