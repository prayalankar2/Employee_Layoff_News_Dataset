  The labor market is healthy and layoffs outside the energy industry are largely based on employers' individual situations, Challenger said, pointing to Target, which accounted for the bulk of the 6,640 retail sector cuts announced in March. 
  The retailer announced last month it would cut several thousand jobs during the next two years as part of a $2 billion cost-saving plan.  
  "The most iconic job cut of the month was Target, a retailer hit with a data breach, just competing in a new market, felt like it was too top heavy, needed to be more nimble," he said. "So we're not seeing job cuts that come right now from companies that are just doing poorly."
