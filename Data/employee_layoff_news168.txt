  ING said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform, to be rolled out over the next five years in Spain, Italy, France, Austria and the Czech Republic. 
  Those countries are mature, "challenger" markets, where there are dominant incumbent banks and ING is looking to grow -- mostly by online banking with few physical offices. 
  Hamers said that while three to four years ago banking digitalization was taking off in a few northern European countries, it was now taking off everywhere. 
  Big software companies like Google and Facebook had raised customer expectations in all the countries in which ING are operating, he said. 
  ING has had success, especially in Germany, with a business model focused on maintaining little physical presence and conducting its retail business entirely online, winning customers from Deutsche Bank. 
  In the Netherlands and Benelux, where most of the job cuts will fall -- 3,500 in Belgium and 2,300 in the Netherlands -- the company is integrating its Record Bank subsidiary, Belgium's third largest pure retail bank, with ING. 
  The company plans to take 1.1 billion euros in charges, of which 1 billion euros will be in the next quarter, for redundancies.
