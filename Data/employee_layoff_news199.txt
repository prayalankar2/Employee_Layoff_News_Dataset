  The job cuts come as the retailer is working to shed its "Whole Paycheck" nickname and its reputation for high prices. Whole Foods said in May that it would launch a new chain of smaller, more value-focused shops next year. 
  The company, which dominates the natural and organic grocery category, faces increasing competition from specialty and mainstream retailers.  
  The New York's Department of Consumer Affairs said in June it was investigating Whole Foods after finding that the company charged too much for some prepackaged foods at nine of its New York City stores. 
  The company's shares were down 0.5 percent at $30.96 in low volumes in premarket trading on Monday.
