  The merger was in part to help weather the oil price downturn that started in mid-2014, and its aftermath. Since 2014, Halliburton has reduced its headcount by about a third and slashed costs as its clients sharply reduce activity. 
  "Life has changed in the energy industry," CEO Dave Lesar said. President Jeff Miller said, "My definition of an unsustainable market is one where all service companies are losing money in North America, which is where we are now." 
  The company's first-quarter revenue dropped to $4.2 billion from $7.05 billion. Miller said Halliburton's margins have been resilient, with "decremental margins of only 22 percent for the quarter."
