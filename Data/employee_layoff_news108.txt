  To date, employers have announced 363,408 planned layoffs, 6.2 percent fewer than the 387,384 cuts announced through September, 2013. 
  "There have been a couple of bumps in the road for the economy lately, which caused consumer confidence to drop in its latest reading. However, as this report shows, the recent hiccups have not resulted in widespread layoffs. Job security is being helped by the fact that corporate profits remain near record highs. So, we may see some ebb and flow in the rate of hiring, but employers, at this point, are reluctant to make any over-correction in workforce levels," John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.
