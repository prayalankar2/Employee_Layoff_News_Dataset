  Short said that many of the other layoffs have been announced by companies that are "hurting from the decline in commodity prices, weakness in China and currency headwinds over the last 6 or so quarters." However, Short is optimistic that these companies can recover. 
  "I believe many of those issues will continue to dissipate, however, as the year goes on. We're already seeing the dollar stabilize, oil prices rising, and concerns around China seem to be waning," she said. 
  Short said that given the circumstances, she's been paying extra attention to reported revenue. 
  "These are companies doing what they have to do to deliver those bottom-line numbers," Short said. "Sales numbers are less easily manipulated and give a truer sense of how the company is performing."
