But the crash in oil prices  from nearly $110 a barrel in July 2014 to less than $50 six months later  brought a painful retrenchment. The number of rigs in operation fell in tandem with prices  from a peak of nearly 2,000 in late 2014 to just over 400 earlier this year. (Drilling has picked up a bit, to 588 rigs, as of the week of November 18.) 
  The shutdown brought a wave of layoffs  some 20,000 since employment in the sector peaked in 2015  along with pay cuts that have taken a big bite out of oil-patch wages. 
According to the latest data available, from the first quarter of this year, wages for workers in the oil and gas extraction industry were more than a billion dollars less than the first quarter of 2015. On an annualized basis, that represents more than $4 billion in lost wages.
  The sector employs people from a wide range of occupations, from field workers to computer programmers, truck drivers to office administrators. Last year, the industry generated more than $31 billion in wages.
