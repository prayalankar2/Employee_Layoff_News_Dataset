  After widespread backlash for posting pictures of his partying after massive layoffs at J.Crew's corporate headquarters, the clothier's vice president of men's merchandising has been fired, a source with information on the situation told CNBC. 
  Alejandro Rhett came under fire after posting photos to Instagram that seemingly made light of the 175 J.Crew firings that had taken place, featuring hashtags that jokingly referred to "The Hunger Games," which prompted outrage from customers and J.Crew fans on social media. (

Efforts by CNBC to reach Rhett for comment were unsuccessful. Rhett joined the company as an assistant merchant in 2007 before taking on the role as vice president of men's merchandising, according to his LinkedIn page.  
  The posts in question have since been removed but were originally reported by the New York Post.  
 The gaffe came just weeks after J.Crew reported a disappointing first quarter that included an operating loss of just more than $520 million, a 5 percent drop in sales and slipping gross margins.
