  Additional cuts were the result of streamlining at the Glendale, Calif., headquarters of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. Disney combined the two businesses into a single operation last year, in part to save money by eliminating overlapping departments, including marketing and human resources. 
After a period of blistering growth fueled by the "Frozen" and "Star Wars" franchises, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media has recently emerged as an area of concern for some analysts. A lavishly promoted line of interactive toys called Playmation was a sales disappointment last Christmas. Starting in the spring, the unit reported back-to-back quarterly declines in profitability, even as every other Disney division delivered improvements.
Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media reported profit in the second quarter of $357 million, an 8 percent decline from the year-earlier period, something the company attributed to fading sales of "Frozen" merchandise and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The unit's third-quarter profit totaled $324 million, a 7 percent decline.
Disney's fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
