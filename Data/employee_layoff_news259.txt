  The energy sector lead the losses for the quarter. U.S.-headquartered energy companies said they plan to pare back payrolls by 7,747 in March, putting the quarter total at just over 52,900. 
  Pink slips also continued to pile up in the retail sector. Nearly 8,500 cuts in March brought the three-month total to 31,832. And while the computer sector saw fewer layoffs this month, it still sits comfortably in third place for the quarter with payroll reductions totaling about 17,000.  
  "What these sectors share in common is that they are all going through transformational changes," Challenger said. "These changes are necessary and inevitable, but they come with a cost in the form of job loss." 
  The Challenger report comes a day before the Labor Department releases its March jobs data. On Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics said U.S. companies hired 200,000 employees in March.
