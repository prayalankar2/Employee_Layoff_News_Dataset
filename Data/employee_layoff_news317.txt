  Layoffs and restructuring are starting to look like the trends of this earnings season. 
 Halliburton  originally scheduled its earnings call for Monday morning, but announced on Friday that it will delay the report to May 3. This past quarter, the company paid $2.1 billion in restructuring costs, partly attributable to severance costs. Halliburton laid off 6,000 people during the quarter. 
  Estimize's Christine Short said that the companies reporting layoffs with earnings tend to be in sectors that are seeing major headwinds or industrywide transformation. 

  For example, Intel announced last week that it would cut 12,000 jobs or about 11 percent of its workforce by 2017. 
  "Intel's layoffs come at a time when the PC market is in a free-fall, the company is preparing for a long-term decline in that space, while making room for their cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), data centers and wearables segments," Short told CNBC in an email.
