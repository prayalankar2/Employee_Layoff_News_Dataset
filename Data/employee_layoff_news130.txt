  Wall Street firms have hit peak employment, and are now left with little option but to cut headcount. 
 That's the story for most big banks in 2016, which have had to reduce staffing levels, cut compensation, or both, in response to international headwinds and central banks' lower-for-longer interest rate mentality. 
 "A number of these institutions are looking to pull the lever of cost, and that relates to headcount," said Bhushan Sethi, a partner at PwC and head of its financial services people and organization practice. 

  For years following the financial crisis, Wall Street whittled down headcount, slashing more than 20,000 jobs, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Comptroller of New York. Wall Street is widely seen as a proxy for the broader financial services industry. 
For most of the last three years, the banking industry in New York experienced a bit of an employment renaissance, but even the 2015 post-crisis employment high (172,400 jobs) represents an 8 percent slide compared with the precrisis era.
