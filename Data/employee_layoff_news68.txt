  ConAgra is cutting about 1,500 jobs, or approximately 30 percent of its global, office-based workforce, and moving its headquarters to Chicago from Omaha, Nebraska. 
  The company said the job cuts exclude plant positions and do not include any impact from the planned sale of its private label operations. It anticipates about $345 million in one-time charges over the next two to three years related to the restructuring.
ConAgra Foods said Thursday that its plans should result in about $200 million in cost savings, with most of that realized in fiscal 2018. The company said the savings are in addition to approximately $150 million in cost cuts over the last two years.
