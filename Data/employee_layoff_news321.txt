  Even so, the overall headcount is expected to decline by several thousand as the number of consumers who visit branches falls steadily. 
  People with knowledge of the bank's plans said the reduction would come mostly from so-called attrition of back office employees  staff leaving and not being replaced  rather than lay-off programs.

  The biggest US retail bank by deposits has already slashed the headcount at its consumer division by almost 40,000 since 2009, bringing the total at the end of the first quarter of this year to 68,400. 
  Thong Nguyen, president of retail banking, told a conference in New York this week that the numbers would "probably go down to the low 60s." 
  That points to a reduction of as many as 8,400 from the first quarter figure, although this would still mark a slowdown of the pace of job reductions from the bank's post-crisis cost-cutting drive. Mr Nguyen did not provide a timeframe. 
  In the past seven years Bank of America's retail branch count has fallen by about 1,400, or almost a quarter, to 4,690. 
  At the same time it has expanded its online operations. Two weeks ago the number of its mobile banking users surpassed 20m.
