  The pace of job cuts in the United States slowed significantly in March following two consecutive months of downsizing in excess of 50,000 positions, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. 
  U.S. employers announced 36,594 layoffs last month, down 27.6 percent from February, but up 6.4 percent from March 2014. 
  "What we're seeing is slightly higher cuts this year. January, February are often heavier months, and so now as we start to move into the spring, summer, we'll probably see the cuts draw back," John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CNBC's "Squawk Box."
