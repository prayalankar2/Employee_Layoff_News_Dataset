) - U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested the labor market was still tightening.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, Labor Department said on Friday.
Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unusually warm temperatures earlier in the year.
In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast, likely accounting for some of the stepback in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007.
"There probably was a large weather-related factor in there during the measurement week. If you look at the underlying data outside of this singular report and the way it's measured, the data still suggests that job growth is pretty good," said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower.
The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The labor market is expected to hit full employment this year.
