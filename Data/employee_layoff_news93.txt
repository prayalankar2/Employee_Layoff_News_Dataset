  State-owned PetroChina , the mainland's biggest oil and gas  producer, is "substantially overstaffed" and will need to cut jobs to stay competitive, said Bernstein's senior oil and gas analyst, Neil Beveridge on Thursday.
  Beveridge's comments come on the back of the company's full-year results, announced Wednesday, which showed a 70 percent slump in its 2015 profit due to sustained low crude oil prices.
  Net profit declined to 35.52 billion yuan ($5.47 billion) last year, from 107.17 billion yuan in 2014, the state-controlled company said in a filing with the Hong Kong bourse.

  Although the company said it will cut capital expenditure by 5 percent to 192 billion yuan ($30 billion) this year, that may not be enough, Beveridge told CNBC's Squawk Box.
